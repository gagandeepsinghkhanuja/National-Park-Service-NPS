# National-Park-Service-NPS

Background 

The National Park Service API(Application Programming Interface) is a one stop shop to pull photos and essential information about NPS sites (visitor center, camp grounds, events, news alert and articles on natural and cultural features). 

My focus here is on two important aspects: 
1. To harvest parking fee of National Park, National Memorial, National Scenic Trail, National Battlefield, National Monument, National River, National Reserve, National Recreation Area using REST APIs <br />

Fields/Features extracted: <br />
a. ParkCode <br />
b. State <br />
c. Name of the National Park <br />
d. Type of the National Park(Designation) <br />
e. Latitude <br />
f. Longitude  <br />
g. LatLong  <br />
h. Fee USD  <br />
i. Fee Type <br />
j. Fee Description <br />




2. Visualize the harvested data in Tableau and Shiny.
